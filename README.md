# Vert.x, Guice, RxJava real world example

This code shows a real World project with:
- Java 11
- Vert.x (properly mixed with blocking code)
- Guice
- RxJava
- Apache Avro
- ElasticSearch
- Google Cloud Storage

As the code was migrated to Go Lang I decided to leave it for anyone who is interested in these technologies.
